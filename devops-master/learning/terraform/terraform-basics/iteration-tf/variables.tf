# (Optional) variables.tf for Terraform Iteration Example

# This file is not required for the basic iteration example, but you can define variables here if you want to make the server names dynamic.

# Example:
# variable "server_names" {
#   description = "List of server names to iterate over."
#   type        = list(string)
#   default     = ["web1", "web2", "web3"]
# }
