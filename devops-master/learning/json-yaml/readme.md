## 💡 Why Learn YAML?

YAML is essential for:
- **Kubernetes configurations** - Deployments, services, configmaps
- **Docker Compose** - Multi-container applications
- **CI/CD pipelines** - GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Jenkins
- **Configuration management** - Ansible playbooks, Terraform
- **API documentation** - OpenAPI/Swagger specs
- **Data serialization** - Logs, exports, data exchange

Each topic includes practical examples and real-world use cases to help you understand how YAML is used in DevOps and software development.
